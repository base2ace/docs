# **1️⃣ 📌 Technical Breakdown of the System**
## **🧠 1. Neuromorphic AI Engine (Brain-Inspired Memory Model)**
### **🔧 How It Works:**
- Uses **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** instead of traditional deep learning models.
- **Associates files based on past access, dependencies, and disaster type.**
- Mimics **Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)** like human memory recall.

### **🛠 Components:**
| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** | Mimics brain-like decision-making for file prioritization |
| **Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)** | Learns and predicts file relationships |
| **Priority-Based Retrieval Model** | Assigns importance scores to files |
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent** | Continuously improves recovery predictions |

## **⚡ 2. AI-Powered File Prioritization Model**
### **🔧 How It Works:**
- AI **learns from user behavior** to identify **high-value files.**
- Assigns **dynamic priority scores** based on:
  ✅ **Usage frequency**  
  ✅ **Application dependency graphs**  
  ✅ **Disaster recovery context**  

### **🛠 Components:**
| **Metric** | **Weighting Factor** | **Example Usage** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| **File Access Frequency** | 30% | Frequently used files get higher priority |
| **System Dependency Score** | 25% | OS/system files restored first in crashes |
| **Disaster Type Impact** | 20% | Ransomware → restore most recent clean data |
| **User Criticality Weight** | 15% | High-priority users get instant recovery |
| **AI Predicted Importance** | 10% | Reinforcement learning refines future restores |

---

## **⚙️ 3. AI-Driven Data Recall Mechanism**
### **🔧 How It Works:**
- Instead of restoring data **file by file**, AI **pre-loads the most important files** first.
- Uses **predictive pre-fetching** → AI **guesses the next files needed** before they are requested.
- If ransomware attacks occur, AI **recovers only clean data** from backups.

### **🛠 Components:**
| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Predictive File Pre-Fetching** | Preloads most-likely needed files for instant recovery |
| **Cybersecurity-Aware Data Recall** | Detects and skips corrupted or infected files |
| **Real-Time Adaptive Restoration** | Adjusts recovery sequence in real-time |
